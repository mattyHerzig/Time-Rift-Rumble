## Inspiration
We wanted to create a fun game that somehow incorporated the theme, "time is running out". We decided on a time-themed battle royale, where you fight between up to 9 friends and aim to complete the obstacle course as fast as possible before the time finishes ticking down.

## How we built it
We built the game with Roblox Studio, Blender, and Inkscape, while coding UI and obstacles with Luau.

## Challenges we ran into
Our initial vision was too large and we had to down-scale and scrap a lot of our initial ideas. A large challenge was the UI that a couple of our dedicated team members dug into. We really tried to avoid using premade assets throughout our build â€” as you may or may not have noticed, almost everything is ours (including the music)! A large component of our game was going to be power ups, and for this we planned an inventory system. In the process of making the inventory system, however, was where a lot of problems were ran into. If we decided to use a premade asset for the inventory system, we would have power-ups and gameplay devices that would increase the fun of the game exponentially!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had some very incredible models one of our team members made through blender (especially the time ship!). We also created some incredible obstacles and cutscenes that keep the overall experience fresh and fun despite not meeting our initial vision.

## What we learned
We realized that your initial vision for the project may have been too ambitious. This led to the need to downscale and scrap some initial ideas to make the project more manageable. Our effort to minimize premade assets required more time and effort but we hope contributed to the uniqueness of your game. We encountered difficulties while developing the inventory system, which was essential for implementing power-ups and gameplay devices. These challenges taught valuable lessons in software development and problem-solving. We recognize that using premade assets for the inventory system could have greatly enhanced the gameplay experience, we learned the importance of balancing resource allocation and the potential benefits of leveraging existing assets.

## What's next for Time Rift Rumble
The concept means that we have near limitless potential for new levels and obstacles in future updates if we can put our heads together once more! Thanks for playing!
